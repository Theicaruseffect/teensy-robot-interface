# Teensy 3.1 Robot Interface USB Device
### Phillip Nash

## Objective

I need a USB device capable of being able to communicate with
various external peripherals that I'm currently using for a
robotics project i'm currently working on. The USB module will (eventually)
support the following:

	1) Controlling motor speeds 			(using PWM)
	2) Interfacing with an alphanumeric display 	(using i2c)
	3) Gyroscope, accelerometers etc 		(using i2c)
	4) Interfacing with a set of buttons and a dial (using i2c)
	5) Controlling servos				(using PWM)
	6) Reading LiDAR readings			(using PWM)
	5) And possibly much more....			(using your imagination)

Each of these will have their own endpoints for communications.

## Usage

Run the ./build.sh script to compile the firmware and upload this to the Teensy 3.1.
This requires the installation of the following:

	arm-none-eabi-gcc
	arm-none-eabi-as
	arm-none-eabi-ar
	arm-none-eabi-ld

## Credit

The code for initially configuring and controlling the Teensy's USB module
was developed by (http://kevincuzner.com/2014/12/12/teensy-3-1-bare-metal-writing-a-usb-driver/).
Interfacing and configuring the various hardware and configuring the USB endpoints is done
by myself.
